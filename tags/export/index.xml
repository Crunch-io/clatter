      <description>We first released the tab book feature a while back, and since then, we&amp;rsquo;ve collected a number of great suggestions for how to enrich the feature. Our recent release includes several of those enhancements, most of which are new options available to you in the &amp;ldquo;export tab book&amp;rdquo; panel.
