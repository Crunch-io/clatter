One of the things about Crunch that we’re the most excited about is how much we can improve the way you deliver data to your clients, because your delivery tool and your analysis tool (for both you and your clients) are now one and the same. It’s a big step forward from old workflows of emailing Excel or PDF files, as the flow of information is now truly a two-way street.

To that end, we’ve added a new feature to give you more insight into who is looking at your data and when. Introducing the dataset **Users** page.

{{< figure src="../images/DatasetUsers.png" class="centered-image">}}

This page lets you see who is accessing your data, how they received that access, their level of access, and when was the last time they looked at or worked with the data. Access this information for any dataset by clicking the dataset name, selecting **Properties**, and then selecting the **Users** tab.

The list shows the name, email address, permissions, and most recent access time for each user with access to the dataset. To sort the list, click a column header to sort by it. If you need to look for a particular user, the list can be filtered using the **Filter users** field at the top. Clicking a user’s permissions will open the dataset’s [Permissions](http://support.crunch.io/crunch/crunch_permissions-and-defaults.html) or the project’s [Members](http://support.crunch.io/crunch/crunch_project-management.html), as appropriate.

In the future, we'll be adding more information to allow data owners to understand better how their clients are interacting with them. As always, if you have questions or suggestions for improvement, please let us know at [support@crunch.io](mailto:support@crunch.io).
