We first released the [tab book feature](http://support.crunch.io/crunch/crunch_tabbooks.html) a while back, and since then, we've collected a number of great suggestions for how to enrich the feature. Our recent release includes several of those enhancements, most of which are new options available to you in the "export tab book" panel.

## Export all on a single page

The first new option is page layout. A common request we received was to be able to export all tables in a tab book to a single sheet in the Excel workbook, rather than exporting each table to its own worksheet. While having each table in its own sheet might be more readable when you're looking at just one, it is difficult in Excel to click through the tabs in a workbook to scan through the whole tab book. For browsing lots of results in Excel, scrolling down a single worksheet is often less tedious.

The default of one-table-per-sheet is unchanged, but to export a tab book with all tables stacked on a single Excel worksheet, toggle the "layout" setting in the export panel.

## Include a table of contents

A table of contents can also be useful when it comes to navigating a large tab book. If you choose to add a table of contents to your tab book, the first sheet will show a list of all tables in the tab book. You can click an item to navigate directly to it â€“ with to the relevant sheet if exporting to multiple sheets or to the appropriate place in the single large table if exporting to a single page. This provides another easy way to navigate through a large tab book.

## Enable hypothesis testing

Hypothesis testing has been enabled in multitables for some time, providing a way to easily spot values that exceed or fall short of the value expected for the population if the null hypothesis holds true. Previously these results were not available once you exported the tab book to Excel. Now, if you have hypothesis testing enabled, when you export a tab book to Excel the cell shading and p-value key will appear in the Excel spreadsheet.

## Unweighted counts

Previously, if you requested a tab book with a weight applied to the dataset, the "N" or "base" row of counts beneath the tables were also weighted. These are now unweighted, as they are throughout the Crunch.io app. This change allows you to see how many rows or observations in the dataset are used to compute each cell in the tables.
